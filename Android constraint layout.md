## Contraint Layout

This is really simillar to `RelativeLayout`.

I think `ContraintLayout` has serveral convenience points compared with `RelativeLayout`.
1. It is easy to handle `GONE` property.
    - In `RelativeLayout`, when a view is `GONE`, other views relative with the view also change their properties.
2. `ConstraintLayout` can set views with rate using `bias` property.

I have been developing Android for 6 years. So I feel `RelativeLayout` is more comfortable than `ConstraintLayout`. I think you just choose one that is more comfortable for you.
