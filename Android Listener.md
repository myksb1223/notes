## Listener

Think a user taps a button.

1. Android OS can catch the event.
2. We can process the event two way.
    - OS notify the event to the button.
    - The button has a listener can check a event is occurred.

3. First case is so complicated. Because OS has all functions to process all events. So that's why we use a listener.
